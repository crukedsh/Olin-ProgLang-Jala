 # Jala
 
 J-ish Interpreter in Scala 
 
 Developers: Zhengyang Feng; Hong Giap Tee
 
 This repo serves as the final project of the course Programming Language in Olin College of Engineering, instructed by Dr. Riccardo Pucella.
 
 To run, 
```bash
    cd src
    scalac jala.scala
    scala Shell
```

 Actually, intellij is used to develop the project, and we currently have no idea how to professionally build up sbt :flushed:
 
 For info, see `doc/`.
